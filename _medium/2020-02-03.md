Can prime numbers be written as the sum of two squares? For 13 this is possible (2²+3²), but for example, 3 cannot be written in this way. Pierre de Fermat came up with a theorem on this topic, for which Don Zagier, an American mathematician gave a proof, which astonishingly is just one sentence long.
