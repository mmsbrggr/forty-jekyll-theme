As a PhD student supervised by Laura Kov√°cs and Ezio Bartocci, my mission is to bring certainty to domains which are uncertain in nature. What sounds like a contradiction at first, reveals itself as an intriguing and highly relevant research area.
Probabilistic Programs, Machine Learning, and stochastic systems are all around us and influence our daily lives. Using formal methods can not only make these systems safer but can further have a beneficial feedback effect on the development of such technologies.

I am currently working on the [ProbInG](https://probing-lab.github.io/) project.
